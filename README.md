# Mobile application Install instructions for Desktop Testing/Viewing
1. Pull the latest master branch onto your local computer. 
2. Open Command Prompt (CMD) in Windows or Terminal in Linux or Mac. The Visual Studio Code terminal can also be used.
3. Navigate to the "ITRW322" folder with the 'cd' command (example: 'cd C:\Users\ipadc\Documents\Cloned repos\ITRW322\')
4. If this is your first time running the program, run the following command: 'npm install ionic -g'.
5. After the above mentioned command has completed, run: 'npm install'.
6. Once done, simply run 'ionic serve -l' (this is a L) to see the Application in for both Android and iOS devices. (You may need to install Ionic Lab at first). If this does not work, you can run 'ionic serve' and exclude the '-l'.
