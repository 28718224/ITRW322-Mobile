# Mobile application Install instructions for Desktop testing and viewing
1. Pull the latest master branch to your local PC
2. Open command prompt in windows or terminal in linux. I use visual studio code whose terminal also works for this.
3. Navigate to the ITRW322 folder with the CD command ( example cd C:\Users\ipadc\Documents\Cloned repos\ITRW322\
4. Run npm install ionic -g if this is your first time running the program.
5. Run npm install after the operation completes.
6. Once done simply run ionic serve -l (this is a L) to see the app in both android and IOS version. You may need to install lab but you need only do this the first time. If this does not work simply use ionic serve withoutbthe -l
